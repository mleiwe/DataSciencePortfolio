# Facial Recognition for Sea Turtles
This demo is just a brief aspect of the Sea Turtles challenge I did with FruitPunchAI. As part of the feature extraction team I worked in a team of 3 on developing facial recognition with LightGlue
A [blog](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/tracking-turtles-how-ai-helps-conservationists-to-re-identify-sea-turtles) post that describes the full project is also available on the FruitPunch website.

Briefly, we found that our implementation of LightGlue with an improved evaluation metric using Wasserstein distances improved LightGlue's top5 accuracy from 77% to 92% and out competed the 2 other AI approaches ([Metric Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/metric-learning-tips-n-tricks-2e4cfee6b75b), and [LoFTR ](https://zju3dv.github.io/loftr/)
