# DataSciencePortfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio the intent is to provide a showcase of the data science and data analysis projects that I've done.
Click on the links below to check out some of the projects that I've done

To find out more about me check out the [pptx](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/Introduction/WhoAmI_PlusOneCaseStudy.pptx) or check out the [google slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z9ctxT7zOCgElMMbZL1SyI6LiEEJxAnz_YTPMoUKxII/edit?usp=sharing)

## Selected Projects
- [dCrawler](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/dCrawler): A new clustering algorithm that utilises a single distance threshold. Ideal for when you don't know how many clusters there should be but all the points should be closely related.

[dCrawler Demonstration](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/assets/29621219/de4ea1c5-5647-4c7a-a54f-5da4afb69c3d)

- [CancerDetection](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/CancerDetection): As part of the ML zoomcamp training this was an exercise to get familiar with deploying a solution using docker images. In this example I used features extracted from histological samples containing malignant or benign tumours. I discovered that by reducing the features via PCA to 10 prinicipal components and utilising a logisitic regressor I could produce a model that produced an F1 score of >0.975 on the validation data set.

- [Correcting Chromatic Aberration](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/ChromaticAberration): In biological imaging often the colours smeer (chromatic aberration) which hinders any further analysis. I noticed that we could model the aberration and so reverse its effects to produce an accurate image. This meant we could keep unaffected areas the same (e.g. E) while correcting the distorted areas (e.g. F)
