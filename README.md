# DataSciencePortfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio the intent is to provide a showcase of the data science and data analysis projects that I've done.
Click on the links below to check out some of the projects that I've done

- [dCrawler](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/dCrawler): A new clustering algorithm that utilises a single distance threshold. Ideal for when you don't know how many clusters there should be but all the points should be closely related.
[dCrawler Demonstration](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/assets/29621219/de4ea1c5-5647-4c7a-a54f-5da4afb69c3d)

- [Correcting Chromatic Aberration](https://github.com/mleiwe/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/ChromaticAberration): In biological imaging often the colours smeer (chromatic aberration) which hinders any further analysis. I noticed that we could model the aberration and so reverse its effects to produce an accurate image.
